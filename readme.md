####What is a Weave Drafter?####
A "Weave Draft" is a system of grids, a special kind of notation, that describes how to set up a loom. [This page describes it well](http://www.weaverscraft.com/hints.html).

####The Basics:####
1. The grid on the top-left tells the weaver to attach the warps to harnesses.
2. The grid on the top-right tells the weaver to attach the harnesses to treadles. In other words, this grid describes the various combinations of harnesses that will be lifted throughout the weave.
3. The grid on the right tells the weaver when to use which treadle. It describes which warps should be lifted at each pass of the shuttle.
